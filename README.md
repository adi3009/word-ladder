word-ladder
===========

Scala meetup programming challenge.

===========

We are given a dictionary of five letter words (a word list by [Donald Knuth](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/sgb-words.txt>)). 
For any two words in the dictionary we have to find all possible word ladders between them. 
The words in the ladder must exist in the dictionary.
